In the given problem, we want to see if a watermelon weighing an even number of kilograms can be divided into two even-weighted parts. The watermelon must be divisible by 2. A watermelon that weighs 2 kilograms is acceptable as it can be divided into two parts both weighing 1 kilogram. For other even numbers, if a watermelon is divisible by 2 it can be divided into two equal parts.\nSo we should exclude the scenario where the watermelon is divided into two 1-kilogram parts. Thus \"x != 2\" is added in the condition.\n\nNote: The above solution doesn't cover the scenario where watermelon is less than 2 kilograms. As per the problem statement, 'Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos' (the weight of watermelon should be even). We may have to add a separate condition to handle the scenario where the weight of the watermelon is less than 2.\n\nHere is the more simplified version of code without handling less than 2 kilos:\n\nx = gets.chomp.to_i\nif x.even? && x > 1\n  puts \"YES\"\nelse\n  puts \"NO\"\nend\n### Instruction:\nWhat does the phrase \"I don't like to think about death\" translate to in Spanish?"
