            "Fix a buggy program written in Ruby language to solve the following programming problem:\nDescription: Ann has recently started commuting by subway. We know that a one ride subway ticket costs a rubles. Besides, Ann found out that she can buy a special ticket for m rides (she can buy it several times). It costs b rubles. Ann did the math; she will need to use subway n times. Help Ann, tell her what is the minimum sum of money she will have to spend to make n rides?\nInput Specification: The single line contains four space-separated integers n, m, a, b (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m,\u2009a,\u2009b\u2009\u2264\u20091000) \u2014 the number of rides Ann has planned, the number of rides covered by the m ride ticket, the price of a one ride ticket and the price of an m ride ticket. \nOutput Specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum sum in rubles that Ann will need to spend.\n\nSample Input:\n6 2 1 2\nSample Output:\n6\n\nSample Input:\n5 2 2 3\nSample Output:\n8\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first sample one of the optimal solutions is: each time buy a one ride ticket. There are other optimal solutions. For example, buy three m ride tickets.\nTake input from standard input and output to standard output\n\nHere is the code with a bug of WRONG_ANSWER:\n\nn, m, a, b = $stdin.readline.split.map(&:to_i)\n\nv = []\nm_count = 0\nwhile m_count<n\n    n_count = n - m*m_count\n    n_count = n_count>0 ? n_count : 0\n    s = m_count*b + n_count*a\n    #puts \"n_count=#{n_count}, m_count=#{m_count}, s=#{s}\"\n    v << s\n    m_count += 1\nend\n\nputs v.min\n\n\nProvide the fixed Ruby code without any description or extra tokens.\n\nFixed source code:",
