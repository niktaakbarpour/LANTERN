            "Fix a buggy program written in Ruby language to solve the following programming problem:\nDescription: Mahmoud and Ehab play a game called the even-odd game. Ehab chooses his favorite integer n and then they take turns, starting from Mahmoud. In each player's turn, he has to choose an integer a and subtract it from n such that:  1\u2009\u2264\u2009a\u2009\u2264\u2009n.  If it's Mahmoud's turn, a has to be even, but if it's Ehab's turn, a has to be odd. If the current player can't choose any number satisfying the conditions, he loses. Can you determine the winner if they both play optimally?\nInput Specification: The only line contains an integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009109), the number at the beginning of the game.\nOutput Specification: Output \"Mahmoud\" (without quotes) if Mahmoud wins and \"Ehab\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nSample Input:\n1\nSample Output:\nEhab\n\nSample Input:\n2\nSample Output:\nMahmoud\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first sample, Mahmoud can't choose any integer a initially because there is no positive even integer less than or equal to 1 so Ehab wins.In the second sample, Mahmoud has to choose a\u2009=\u20092 and subtract it from n. It's Ehab's turn and n\u2009=\u20090. There is no positive odd integer less than or equal to 0 so Mahmoud wins.\nTake input from standard input and output to standard output\n\nHere is the code with a bug of WRONG_ANSWER:\n\nn = gets.chomp\nif n%2 == 0\n    puts \"Mahmoud\"\nelse\n    puts \"Ehab\"\nend\n\nProvide the fixed Ruby code without any description or extra tokens.\n\nFixed source code:",
