We can't divide watermelon if the weight is less than 4 or if it's not even. Also, we need to output \"YES\" not \"True\" and \"NO\" not \"False\" (since it might be the case that a valid division is not possible, so we should print \"NO\").\n\nThe line shift = num >> 1; is using bitwise shifting to divide num by 2. But since we need to verify if the result of this operation (when left-shifted back) equals the original number, we'd better use num % 2 == 0.\n\nThe fixed line should be something like this:\n\nif (num < 4 || num % 2 != 0) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"NO\");\n} else {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"YES\");\n}\n\nThe fixed C# code checks if the weight of the watermelon is divisible by 2. If it's divisible, then we can divide the watermelon into two even parts and output \"YES\", if it's not divisible, then we can't do that and output \"NO\"."
